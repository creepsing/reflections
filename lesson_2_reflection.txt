What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It makes .git directory thus makes a checkpoint that it could know that this directory is under git control

How is the staging area differnt from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	staging area separately shows you which files would be commited before you really commit.
	this allows you to think prudently and help you not to make repository cluttered or messy.
	you can rollback before you commit in the staging area.
